# Gif Grabber (with hooks!)

## Summary

This repo is just a demo to explain the basics of React Hooks.

Start the project locally by cloning the repo and running `npm run start` in the CLI; load the project on localhost:3000. The real value of the project can be found in following the numerically ordered jsx files, in which the comments will guide a reader through the basics of how an app can be built - step by step - with React Hooks, approaching the complexity of traditional class-based React components.

Future goals include adding more components, additional styling, and exploring how to measure the performance of hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
